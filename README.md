My name is **Mini Bhati**. 

I am a *UI/UX* enthusiast currently working as a software engineer at Cisco. I ❤️ Angular and I am an active contributor to the Angular community. My interests lie in making the user experience memorable and performance optimization. In the past, I have been doing various engineering, and support roles delivering Angular applications in the finance and education domain.
