## Hi, I’m Mini Bhati 👋

I’m a senior frontend engineer with 11+ years of experience building, evolving, and maintaining
large-scale UI systems — primarily with Angular.

My work focuses on **how frontend systems behave over time**, not just how components are written.

### What I care about
- Frontend architecture and system boundaries
- Engineering decision-making and trade-offs
- Performance, maintainability, and developer experience
- Designing UI systems that scale with teams
- AI-assisted development as a **thinking and reasoning tool**, not a shortcut

### How I use this GitHub
This is not a tutorial repository.

I use this space to:
- Explore Angular internals and system behavior
- Document architectural experiments and trade-offs
- Capture learnings from real-world frontend systems
- Maintain notes and prototypes that help me reason better as an engineer

Some repositories may look unfinished — that’s intentional.  
They represent **ongoing thinking**, not polished demos.

### Writing & technical notes
I write occasionally to clarify my own understanding and share lessons learned.

Older posts focus on fundamentals; newer writing explores system-level concerns and engineering judgment.

- DEV.to: https://dev.to/minibhati

### Current focus
- Angular at scale: change detection, DI scopes, state boundaries
- Frontend system design beyond individual frameworks
- Using AI to improve code reviews, refactoring, and architectural reasoning

### Long-term direction
I’m intentionally growing toward a **Principal Engineer role**, with a focus on
scalable frontend systems, technical leadership, and community contribution.
