## Hi, I’m Mini Bhati 👋

I’m a senior frontend engineer with 11+ years of experience building, evolving, and maintaining
large-scale UI systems — primarily with Angular.

My work focuses on **how frontend systems behave over time**, not just how components are written.

### What I care about
- Frontend architecture and system boundaries
- Engineering decision-making and trade-offs
- Performance, maintainability, and developer experience
- Designing UI systems that scale with teams
- AI-assisted development as a **thinking and reasoning tool**, not a shortcut

### How I use this GitHub
This is not a tutorial repository.

I use this space to:
- Explore Angular internals and system behavior
- Document architectural experiments and trade-offs
- Capture learnings from real-world frontend systems
- Maintain notes and prototypes that help me reason better as an engineer

Some repositories intentionally capture decisions *in progress*. I keep intermediate states visible because that’s where most real-world engineering judgment is formed.

### Writing & technical notes
I write occasionally to clarify my own understanding and share lessons learned.

Older posts focus on fundamentals; newer writing explores system-level concerns and engineering judgment.

### Who this GitHub is for
This GitHub is intended for:
- Frontend engineers working on production systems
- Engineers transitioning into Staff / Principal roles
- Developers who care about system boundaries, not just components

### Where to start
- **angular-internals-lab** → Angular behavior, DI scopes, change detection
- **enterprise-application-systems** → Frontend architecture at scale
- **frontend-engineering-notes** → Cross-cutting system design notes
- **javascript-behind-the-frameworks** → Constraints that shape frameworks
